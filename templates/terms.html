            <h4>Terms of use</h4>
            <p>
                All data here are released under a <a href="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/stellent/groups/corporatesite/@policy_communications/documents/web_document/wtd003207.pdf">Fort Lauderdale Agreement</a> for the benefit of the wider biomedical community. You can freely download and search the data, and we encourage the use and publications of frequency data for specific sets of variants (for instance, assessing a set of candidate causal variants observed in a collection of rare disease patients). However, we ask that you not publish global (genome-wide) analyses of these data until after the ExAC flagship paper has been published, estimated to be in early 2015.
            </p>
            <p>
                If youâ€™re uncertain which category your analyses fall into, please <a href="mailto:exomeconsortium@gmail.com">email us</a>.

            <h4>Citation in publications</h4>
            <p>

                </li>
            </ul>

                The authors would like to thank the Exome Aggregation Consortium and the groups that provided exome variant data for comparison. A full list of contributing groups can be found at <a href="http://exac.broadinstitute.org/participants">http://exac.broadinstitute.org/participants</a>.
