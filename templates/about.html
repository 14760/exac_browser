                    The Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) is a coalition of investigators seeking to collect and harmonize exome sequencing data from a wide variety of large-scale sequencing projects, and to make summary data available for the wider scientific community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The data set provided on this website spans over 60,000 unrelated individuals sequenced as part of various disease-specific and population genetic studies (see list <a class="about_links" href="/about">here</a>). We have removed individuals affected by severe pediatric disease, so this data set should serve as a useful reference set of allele frequencies for severe disease studies.

                <p>
                    A list of ExAC Principal Investigators and groups that have contributed data to the current release is available <a class="about_links" href="/about">here</a>.

                    All data here are released under a Fort Lauderdale Agreement. That means you can freely search the data, and use it for publications focused on a small number of variants (for instance, a set of candidate causal variants observed in a set of rare disease patients). However, we ask that you not publish global (genome-wide) analyses of these data until after the ExAC flagship paper has been published, estimated to be in early 2015. If youâ€™re uncertain which category your analyses fall into, please <a href="mailto:exomeconsortium@gmail.com">email us</a>.
